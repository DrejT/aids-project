        "Because it has so many surprises, \u201cDeadpool and Wolverine\u201d deserves a second look \u2013 even if you were hesitant to take a first. It has laughs for everyone and plenty of profanity to make sure the wrong crowd doesn\u2019t embrace it.",
        "Yes, it\u2019s raunchy. Yes, it\u2019s bloody. But it also one of the best films of the year.",
        "Who needs a reasonable plot when the ride is so much fun?",
        "Hugh Jackman back again as Wolverine is an absolute treat and the cameos are out of this world amazing!!",
        "The premise is fine \u2013 and the return of some old favourites will place it in a special spot in the hearts of comic book fans but like so many of the current day Marvel films the plot itself is kind of bland and it never really overcomes it.",
        "Reynolds and Jackman lean into their characters and the fun therein as they muddle through the Marvel universe and timeline. For fans of the foul-mouthed mercenary, this movie will deliver. A movie built on personality and nostalgia. I'll give it a B+.",
        "It's light on story and substance, but heavy on fun, gags, action, and chemistry from our charismatic leads.",
        "What do we end up with? Kind of a dead wolf that is brought back by Deadpool.",
        "For as much as Deadpool & Wolverine is a showcase for all Marvel\u2019s new toys, it\u2019s more than JUST that. It\u2019s...a tribute to the franchise that launched the era of superhero films we\u2019re still living through. And it\u2019s that sincerity that saves the film.",
        "Here\u2019s the thing. This is exactly what Marvel needed. After so many failed or flat-out uninteresting restarts, they asked the merc with a mouth and his angry friend to chime in and give the universe a much-needed makeover.",
        "Deadpool & Wolverine isn\u2019t so much a film as a meme machine, filled to the rafters with asides, inside jokes and visual subtext.",
        "The cameos, the jokes, and Hugh Jackman\u2019s legitimately good performance cover a lot of visual crimes.",
        "While the movie continues to offer its treasured brand of off-colour heroism, the one thing that sets this chapter apart from its predecessors are the cameos.",
        "Isn\u2019t getting snarky about Marvel movies my job?",
        "Reynolds is charming and funny, but he graciously allows Jackman to be all those things too.",
        "Considering how disappointing blockbusters have been layely, Deadpool & Wolverine delivers what is expected. Not as surprising as funny and entertaining. For all the shenaningans they pull off, it closes its saga way solid than other franchises.",
        "It's exactly what a Deadpool movie should be and kudos to Disney for having the brains and balls to let it be that.",
        "Everything about the movie is extreme as it takes an everything-but-the-kitchen-sink approach, attacking from all sides in every department with an I-don\u2019t-give-a-damn posture.",
        "If you enjoyed the fan service of \u201cSpider-Man: No Way Home\u201d (2021) and \u201cDoctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness\u201d (2022), then you are in for a treat, and you should stay for all the closing credits.",
        "Sassy, crowd-pleasing, satirical live-action comic book adventure is basically a bickering bromance between wise-cracking Ryan Reynolds' fun-loving, red spandex-clad pansexual antihero Deadpool and Hugh Jackman's snarling, steel-clawed Wolverine.",
        "Jackman makes it work. Refusing to coast by, he rises to the challenge of bringing something new to his portrayal of Wolverine, who\u2019s angrier, funnier and not especially heroic this time out.",
        "\u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d is a fun excursion requiring the pair to carry a huge load. I wish they could have packed light. Marvel fanatics might not mind carrying the load, but the rest of us might want to let it go, let it go, let it go to streaming.",
        "There\u2019s a fair amount of fun to be had with Deadpool & Wolverine, but entertainment and spectacle don\u2019t always equal a good film.",
        "Deadpool & Wolverine is the most laugh-filled fun that I have had in the theater in recent memory. Ryan Reynolds' hijinks mixed with the gravitas of Jackman's Wolverine is a match made in heaven. Story takes a back seat, but they more than make up for it.",
        "It is superhero cinema at its smirkiest...",
        "Shawn Levy was a bad idea. So was Ryan Reynolds.",
        "The thrill of Deadpool and Wolverine comes from Reynolds skewering his new employers. A mixtape of geeky delights, it\u2019s both an acknowledgement of the problems with superhero movies, and an affectionate tribute to them.",
        "A mind numbing procession of self involved wisecracks, Deadpool & Wolverine positions the Marvel multiverse as a perpetual nightmare of monotonous possibility, defined solely by narcissistic, attention-seeking egos soothed by chaotic ramblings.",
        "It\u2019s amusing at times, especially for fans of the MCU as several Marvel superhero movie stars pop up in cameo roles...",
        "Whether you're a fan or not, Deadpool & Wolverine keeps you engaged with its constant stream of action and humor.",
        "Reynolds, who also gets writing credit, completely outshines Jackman.",
        "Some of the jokes land through sheer volume and force of will, but it feels like you have to endure 40-or-so rectal stabbings for a single juicy zinger.",
        "Deadpool & Wolverine\u2019s cynical mocking of all things Marvel is its secret weapon. No wonder it\u2019s making a killing at the box office.",
        "The tonal battle between the two characters is a walkover. Between the frenzied slapstick violence and battery of gags, two hours plus pass in a finger click.",
        "A Nostalgic Tribute to Marvel\u2019s Past, Though Lacking in Substance.",
        "I insist, Deadpool and Wolverine is not a movie... it is a series of events, or gags, or situations, or sketches... [Full review in Spanish]",
        "The two stars coupled with the massive action scenes and dark humor is enough to entertain anyone who has never seen a comic book movie. Those who have a history with the genre will get an additional level of fun...",
        "As a Marvel film for MCU fans who have a high tolerance for meta humour, this is a large amount of fun, but woe betide anyone going into it without having seen any previous Marvel projects.",
        "Demand for the movie is high and, although it's not the be-all/end-all of superhero movies, its anarchic and rambunctious approach to the genre results in an entertaining hybrid of comic book action and straightforward satire.",
        "With awesome action, heart, humour and a cavalcade of famous faces, Deadpool & Wolverine is the unapologetically fun flick we all need in our lives right now.",
        "It is funny and enjoyable - most of the time.",
        "For as downtrodden Marvel has been the last few years, a movie like Deadpool & Wolverine feels entirely necessary for the brand.",
        "Deadpool & Wolverine is the epitome of a summer blockbuster win. Reynolds and Jackman are comic book perfect in their roles as they balance meta and witty quips, bloody action, and a ton of heart.",
        "Deadpool makes jokes to mask his insecurities, and Ryan Reynolds plays Deadpool to mask his.",
        "It is an unserious movie, loaded with jokes about movies and jokes about movie cliches, as well as just plain old jokes and slapstick comedy. There is hardly a serious bone in its body, despite the high body count.",
        "Deadpool and Wolverine thrives with its gory comedy and regenerative heart, being the Viagra that the MCU needed to give fans another round, since Avengers Endgame.",
        "That rapid fire style, along with the way too-meta approach, ultimately prevents Deadpool & Wolverine from working as a stand-alone cinematic experience.",
        "Avengers/X-Men fans who're looking for fun, keep your ears open. The real party is in the freaky chatter.",
        "Hall H: The Movie, offering up an onslaught of familiar (though largely forgotten) superhero faces intended to elicit knowing, nostalgic nods and applause.",
        "...a predictably bloated blockbuster...",
        "There are times when Deadpool & Wolverine seems to understand the futility of its own fixations. Yet the movie ultimately endorses Deadpool's left-field desire for conformity with tired, oft-stated MCU ideals.",
        "The prime reason \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d exists is how the movie not only references the MCU and crosses over into \u201cX-Men\u201d territory, but dredges up characters from the pre-MCU Marvel movie roster that some viewers may have forgotten ever happened.",
        "The jokes land perfectly, that's a big part of the success, like, talking about the obvious talking about the elephants in the room, all that good stuff, I feel like makes the movie so much more enjoyable.",
        "I\u2019m not entirely immune to the charms of this approach; there\u2019s one casting choice, in particular, that made me smile, almost in spite of myself. It\u2019s not enough to make the movie feel like less of a self-cannibalizing slog.",
        "The first R-rated film in the MCU owned by Disney is a Supercalifragilisticexplicitalidocious spectacle! Arriving in the nick of time to breathe new life into the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",
        "A viciously violent and proudly profane buddy action comedy that will especially play well with MCU devotees.",
        "DEADPOOL AND WOLVERINE is a full-blown comedy disguised as a messy and often inappropriately violent action film. But for those who have been waiting years for something like this, it\u2019s an absolute blast.",
        "It is what it is exactly as promised. Is it the best we've seen Deadpool? No. Is it the best we've seen Wolverine? Absolutely not. Avengers this is not - but is it fun? Sure, just not as amazing as fanboys might have you think.",
        "We have reached tentpole filmmaking as micro-transactional phone game...",
        "A new MCU comedy duo is born. \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d is a bona fide summer blockbuster. it's hard to imagine them topping this one with a follow-up.",
        "Dotted in among the quips and Easter eggs is the superhero equivalent of Toy Story 2, a mournful goodbye to the things we once held dear, even if some of those things weren\u2019t that great to begin with.",
        "The leads elevate the experience somewhat. They find the roughhouse comedy in the premise.",
        "A film for connoisseurs, who are a legion anyway, that looks like an overwhelming success and, of course, also has the courage to go all out, even with dark humor. [Full review in Spanish]",
        "Deadpool & Wolverine is a movie for fans and nostalgics. [Full review in Spanish]",
        "Deadpool & Wolverine is an entertaining love letter to\u2014and funeral service for\u201420th Century Fox\u2019s Marvel movies...",
        "I was so excited to see Deadpool & Wolverine, I made sure to wear my white pants. I was not disappointed!",
        "It's a lot of fun, and a great way to say goodbye to beloved characters...",
        "The titular duo deliver a one-two punch with their iconic performances and brutal action scenes in a chaotic, messy, and hilarious film full of fun surprises.",
        "While the plot won\u2019t really stick with you, the fight sequences paired with one of the best soundtracks will. Deadpool & Wolverine is non-stop laughs, surprises, and fun.",
        "Self-aware, funny, bloody, and trippy.",
        "Each jarring tone change throws us out of the narrative, so little is able to resonate very deeply. As a result, this is a very entertaining film that you watch from a distance, always feeling slightly outside all the in-jokes.",
        "An undeserved tribute to a lot of bad Fox movies that\u2019s just good enough for a couple of laughs, the long awaited onscreen pairing of Deadpool & Wolverine has the goods where it counts. [Full Review in Spanish]",
        "My bet. Hardcore fans will gorge on this heaping Marvel meal; others might prefer to seek their big-screen nourishment elsewhere.",
        "Deadpool & Wolverine is the Airplane! of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",
        "A messy multiverse film overrun with guest appearances and Easter eggs.",
        "The all-round fizzy overtones, the frequent jabs at unapologetically lowbrow humour and the endless servings of violence ensure that even monotony (when it threatens to set in) does not feel as dull as it generally would.",
        "This interminable blockbuster is over two hours of being winked at by film-makers out of ideas. There is another nadir, if that is possible.",
        "Reynolds and Jackman look like their having the time of their lives in this, and we're along for the ride, laughing hysterically at times. The cameos aren't needed, but some of them will definitely make your jaw drop. Great times.",
        "The charms of yesteryear (nearly 10 years ago) largely float around like the remains of a bad, high-fiber meal left unflushed.",
        "Director Shawn Levy (and producer Kevin Feige) are keenly aware that the MCU requires some tweaking. The best way to start doing that is to lovingly drag the living hell out of the MCU, and that\u2019s precisely what Levy has done.",
        "A film can be obnoxious and simultaneously very funny, and Deadpool & Wolverine is frequently hilarious. But it\u2019s also slapdash, repetitive and shoddy looking, with an overreliance on meme-derived gags and achingly meta comic fan in-jokes.",
        "There is nothing in this film that I value in cinema or in the superhero genre. [Full review in Spanish]",
        "\u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d rushes by like an anarchic free for all where the fan servicing combines with funnier forms of corporate self-jabs.",
        "Its performances are all terrific (especially Corrin\u2019s Cassandra, but also great work by its many cameo stars), its action is tight and entertaining, and it\u2019s just nice to see a superhero movie that doesn\u2019t disappoint again.",
        "'Deadpool & Wolverine' is the ultimate tag-team dream. It offers non-stop laughter, wild action, and unexpected surprises, while also poking fun at our exhaustion with Marvel movies.",
        "Deadpool and Wolverine arrives at the nadir of the MCU, unable (and often, unwilling) to escape its ever-consuming vortex of disappointment.",
        "The Superhero Who Swears is still a fun angle, but it was more fun when Deadpool's jokes were at Marvel's expense, not about how great Marvel is.",
        "A theme park movie through and through. From a filmmaking and narrative level, there\u2019s not much substance to the fun and flashiness on screen. Overall, a popcorn film with tons of nostalgia by way of characters and soundtrack to keep dopamine flowing.",
        "Like its prior two entries, the audacious humor and gratuitous violence is front and center. But after a while, the laughs die down and the humor becomes a bit tedious.",
        "Fun-filled and a definite crowd-pleaser, Deadpool & Wolverine easily carves a standout place for itself in the MCU.",
        "A more honest title would be something like Deadpool & Wolverine: A Parade of Familiar Faces and Other Superficial Thrills. When the biggest draw of your movie is who shows up for a surprise, perhaps it is time to reconsider your approach to filmmaking.",
        "This film is fun, but laborious, packed with an overabundance of snappy irreverent one-liners and well-known character cameos in R-rated language and supremely, sadistically bloody SFX combat scenes.",
        "Not everything works. There are stretches where the film seems to really spin its wheels. But when it hits, it hits.",
        "Where it loses this viewer, and likely many of you, is its forgettable journey, one that could have had the makings of an Avenger but instead has us hoping this is Endgame for Wade Wilson.",
        "A great entertainment if you connect with the characteristic humor of this franchise. Of course, if you found it irritating before, get ready for an even bigger dose (Full Review in Spanish)",
        "In the end, I was most pleased with what the movie was not. This isn't a bridge to a new era of Marvel movies. It's not the magic solution to erase Disney's shambolic efforts of the last few years. Really, this is Deadpool's party.",
        "The impossible has been achieved - we're finally sorry for James Mangold.",
        "There is a good chance that this will be the biggest movie of the year and as well it should be. Deadpool and Wolverine is what summer blockbusters should be. Great action sequences, hilarious comedic moments mixed with some of the best cameos.",
        "Is it as good as Logan? Of course not. Is it as good as Deadpool 1 & 2? Not quite. Is it still pretty damn good? Absolutely.",
        "Bringing Reynolds and Jackman into the MCU seemed tricky on paper, but it allows Deadpool & Wolverine to celebrate an early era of comic book movies. Nostalgia reigns supreme, but one of the funniest scripts of the year shines in the action extravaganza.",
        "... a gleeful celebration of pre-MCU fare infused with a decadent dose of classic comics and clever casting, with adrenaline-fueled fan service turned up to eleven and zero apologies for it.",
        "Deadpool & Wolverine is the best thing since Avengers: Endgame and Spider-Man: No Way Home. Whip-smart, deliciously meta, crude, bloody, and unsurprisingly wholesome, it\u2019s everything longtime Marvel fans could dream of for the dynamic duo.",
        "The laid-to-waste 20th Century Fox logo, displayed in a plot-pivotal badlands called The Void, might remind movie lovers of \"Planet of the Apes,\" an original classic, which still offers more meaningful summer sequels than this one ever seriously will be.",
        "A film that solely relies on comedy, action, and fan service, but it does all three of them very well.",
        "Deadpool & Wolverine suffers from weak story structure. Hugh Jackman and Ryan Reynolds do this movie justice because their chemistry is so great.",
        "This proves Marvel isn't dead in the water.",
        "Squeezes by thanks to its energy and rapid fire humor, not to mention the way it pretty much casts out the whole black leather era of the comic book movie...",
        "Deadpool & Wolverine is both great and terrible and it knows it. If the audience knows it too and accepts that they are just as responsible for what they\u2019re seeing as the companies who controlled the properties, then everyone is going to have a good time.",
        "Reynolds co-wrote this obnoxious script with Rhett Reese, Paul Wernick, and Zeb Wells, and the real subject here is not the mystery of existence across time and dimensions, but the cynical exaggerations of showbiz venality.",
        "This film feels like an apology for the universe\u2019s recent missteps, hoping fans will look fondly upon this time with distance.",
        "[A] rollicking fun time and laugh riot from start to finish...a rollicking fun time and laugh riot from start to finish... Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman are in top form...",
        "Deadpool\u2019s third adventure is a fun and funny romp through the multiverse with a surprising amount of heart as well, and a clear sweet spot for the very things it's poking fun at.",
        "The movie is vulgar and hyper violent with Reynolds' signature fourth wall breaking in almost every scene. It's fun to see Jackman back as Wolverine and obviously having fun with the character in a tribute to Marvel and the X-Men franchise.",
        "\u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d is a love letter to the fans. It\u2019s fun, hilarious, moving, and filled with fan service moments. The film doesn\u2019t just entertain, it appreciates its audience. It\u2019s a raunchy, gory and hell of a time in the movie theaters.",
        "Rowdy, raunchy and gooey gory, Deadpool & Wolverine delivers the action-comedy thrills that will attract Marvel acolytes and civilians seeking belly laughs.",
        "Barely a movie, 'Deadpool & Wolverine' is a filmed attempt to realign corporate assets under a new umbrella. It will probably make a billion dollars.",
        "It\u2019s frivolous, but it should be: We\u2019re supposed to enjoy these movies.",
        "Deadpool & Wolverine is the laugh-out-loud, hyper-violent, expletive-fueled, cameo-filled summer highlight you expect it to be",
        "Everything with Deadpool & Wolverine met my expectations. It was funny, heart warming, and the two have perfect chemistry together on screen. The story, and villains could've been stronger, but I still had a blast, and recommend to all.",
        "Ryan Reynolds easily upstages Wolverine Hugh Jackman in an R-rated, ultra-violent, annoyingly indulgent film that provides a few moments of humor, but hardly anything in the way of real thrills.",
        "An epic journey of redemption and second chances, in which the mercenary with a mouth and the fierce X-Man with adamantium claws join forces to save the people they love. [Full review in Spanish]",
        "Deadpool & Wolverine offers a rapid-fire, winkingly self-aware commentary on comic-book franchises (including X-Men) and Disney corporate might.",
        "The tea-up, the pairing of these two characters, is damn-right perfect.",
        "This could have been a cynical exercise, but Deadpool and Wolverine is something a bit more heartfelt...",
        "Deadpool made me laugh. Wolverine too, if only because he\u2019s such an effective straight-man buffer to Reynolds\u2019 all-id performance.",
        "As Deadpool and Wolverine punch, slash, decapitate and eviscerate various bad guys from the Marvel Comics Universe, audiences may be pleasantly surprised to see several well known characters that have dropped out of sight over the years.",
        "Gory, profane, ridiculous, juvenile and thoroughly enjoyable, but definitely not for the wee ones. Get ready for mile-a-minute self-referential jokes, Easter eggs and fourth-wall breaking.",
        "Even draped in copious amounts of irony, the nonstop fan service grows wearisome.",
        "It is a fine line to walk, loving a pop culture phenomenon with all your being, yet being able to make mad sport of it at the same time. Thus is DEADPOOL & WOLVERINE, which manages to be both wickedly funny and curiously reverent.",
        "It is apt that Deadpool\u2019s catchphrase is \u201cmaximum effort,\u201d because instead of feeling like care-free debauchery, this reeks of exhausting, clever-free calculation. It\u2019s every bit as edgy as when an internet parent asks their kid to swear on camera.",
        "It\u2019s almost as if there are two movies fighting for time \u2013 an obsessively bloody and vulgar Deadpool rehash and another messy MCU post-\u201cEndgame\u201d misfire.",
        "This amalgamation of claws and katanas deserved a superior cinematic package.",
        "As this film stands, it\u2019s crowd-pleasing but assembled with gum, toothpicks, and reminders of movies from a past era, whether you liked them or not.",
        "Though the MCU has never served up the cinematic equivalent of fine dining, its films at least used to be hearty fast-food fare. Deadpool & Wolverine feels more like eating a bag of Sour Patch Kids and calling it dinner.",
        "A celebration of trash: as in it revels in Deadpool's brand of trashy humour, but also celebrates the discarded superheroes who we can't help but get sentimental about, following the same easy route to our feelings that Spider-Man: No Way Home took.",
        "Is it a great movie? Nah. It's too slick a Marvel package, with surprisingly meh special effects and an energy that\u2019s more desperation than inspiration. But stars Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman are willing to bust a gut to make you laugh. So there\u2019s that.",
        "Those who aren't fans of Reynolds's meta commentary on the genre itself are going to be irritated. Then again, if you aren't into tasteless 4th wall breaks and grievous bodily trauma, why are you at a Deadpool movie in the first place?",
        "Deadpool & Wolverine is the best the MCU has been since Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. It\u2019s two hours of comic book-driven fan service and delivers entertaining surprises, nostalgic throwbacks, memorable action sequences, and worthwhile performances.",
        "Whilst this is not the LFG game-changer that it\u2019s hyped up to be, what\u2019s undeniable is the amount of sheer fun Deadpool & Wolverine has as one of the entertaining entries in the MCU.",
        "Incredible feat, especially with how they were able to keep certain cameos secret. I absolutely loved this.",
        "Deadpool & Wolverine is just the circlejerk to end all circlejerks, a holding pattern for a franchise that just cannot afford to sit in place any longer",
        "This was so fun and I think that's because you could tell everyone involved seemed to have a really good time making this. Between the soundtrack, performances, humor, and surprises, it's hard to find something not to love!",
        "The most fun Marvel movie I've seen since \"Spiderman: No Way Home\"! The cameos, humor, and chemistry between Reynolds and Jackman makes this an incredibly entertaining romp.",
        "It's a fun time at the movies for genuine fans of Marvel superheroes who have been keeping up with the franchise for the last couple of decades. It won't really land for anyone else, and that's okay.",
        "When all involved are telling you they\u2019re all out of ideas, you should listen.",
        "Deadpool & Wolverine succeeds at what it sets out to do. ... But that very success left me with an oddly distinct discomfort.",
        "Disney pulls no punches with this one. Kevin Feige and Marvel trusted the creatives with Deadpool's latest outing, and it paid off big-time.",
        "This isn\u2019t really a movie. It\u2019s just a lame Reddit thread upvoted by Kevin Feige. Surely, after more than 15 years of cultural dominance, Marvel can do better than that.",
        "A nicely irreverent, hyper-violent and potty-mouthed distraction. Director Shawn Levy taps into some easy chemistry and jaw-dropping comic-timing between his leads. But, nothing can mask the reek of desperation of the IP management that underpins it.",
        "The movie knows that you are slowly getting bored of the numerous timelines and why the new MCU phase would dearly need someone like Wade Wilson and his wisecracking jokes to save it. I mean, the world\u2019s always a little better when it is funny.",
        "It's a stew no one has bothered to taste even as they throw more and more into it because it doesn\u2019t matter what it tastes like, only what can be put into it.",
        "The machine is what will kill superhero films, if we let it. Teasing the future will no longer sell the present. Deadpool & Wolverine is a call to let things matter on their own again, and to peel a few more of these cynical masks off in the process.",
        "While I can acknowledge that there is fun to be had here, there\u2019s something oddly uncomfortable about the whole ordeal.",
        "Deadpool & Wolverine is filled to the brim with shameless fan service that relies on the same plot devices and gimmicks it mocks; but it sure is fun.",
        "While Ryan Reynolds still seems to be having fun playing the cheeky mercenary, both the inside-baseball comedy and the cartoonishly bloody mayhem wear out their welcomes in the film\u2019s final third.",
        "The humour is relentless, mocking from Disney\u2019s acquisition to the stakes of the Marvel Universe. The action sequences are bloody and relentless, but Deadpool\u2019s continuous commentary transforms what could be grim violence into a slapstick spectacle.",
        "Reynolds exhausted that creative well with the first two Deadpool entries and is only dredging up sloshy wet sand this time out.",
        "This film was made by fans for fans, and it is entirely unapologetic about that...if Deadpool broke the fourth wall in his two previous cinematic outings, he sets an atomic bomb beneath it in Deadpool & Wolverine. \"Meta\" doesn't even begin to cover it.",
        "He\u2019s the perfect narrator to begin the extremely long-awaited introduction of the X-Men into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, offering a viciously violent and endlessly enthralling rollercoaster of ill-fated team-ups.",
        "Through Deadpool, Kevin Feige is letting us know that he knows how we feel. And through Wolverine, he's reminding us that there is still a lot of life left in the old (adamantium) bones of the MCU.",
        "[Deadpool & Wolverine is] the anti-MCU movie, flipping through a dusty scrapbook from under the bed that reminds us unceasing uniformity never beats a fast food meal with a last, greasy bite.",
        "It\u2019s over-the-top, overstuffed and light on emotional depth. But it\u2019s also a hell of a fun time, especially if you appreciate Deadpool\u2019s self-aware, meta humour. It\u2019s often infantile but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not funny. You just have to go with it.",
        "Deadpool & Wolverine belongs in the soulless void of corporate cash grabs, desperate to extend the MCU\u2019s shelf life\u2014a sad state of affairs for modern blockbusters.",
        "This is a film that gleefully announces no moment develops from a natural interest in building its story. Instead, it wallows in its outsize state of infallibility. It does what it wants, merely because it can. These characters deserve better. So do we.",

        "Deadpool & Wolverine revels in its source material to the point of extravagance, coming across like the MCU\u2019s take on a Baz Luhrmann flick.",
        "\u2026 the first two films had more heart and emotional gravity than this theme park extravaganza.",
        "As a fun tribute to a fallen studio, this feels like a loving, if gleefully silly, entry into a franchise that doesn't always live up to its potential. But it tries very very hard.",

        "Deadpool & Wolverine plays like an R-rated parody of the Marvel franchise with ADHD.",
        "A bloody bonkers action comedy energized by fiery bromance, mind-blowing cameos & uproarious one-liners. While I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the best MCU movie ever, it certainly is the most fun I\u2019ve had watching a Marvel movie in a long while.",

        "[T]he movie's satirical aims are hollow to the core.",

        "Ryan Reynolds is the new MVP of the MCU, as whenever he's cracking wise, esp in the meta-comments of superhero-dumb, the film hilariously shines. The rest of it, always centered on the good v evil tropes, rises and falls depending on scenario. Mint Man!",

        "Watch the film for the excellent chemistry between the two leads. And for counting all the cameos. And for the gratuitous violence of course. Deadpool & Wolverine shows what films based on comic books can be.",
        "Lets f'in go! The best MCU film experience since Endgame, and the best Deadpool entry yet. Extremely funny, bloody and with plenty of heart. Hugh Jackman is amazing in his return as Logan, while Ryan Reynolds owns the whole thing. [Full review in Spanish]",
        "[It] should be an easy target to hit, but in execution turns out to offer so little of an actual story and feels so seemingly desperate to right whatever ship is still sailing that it ends up generally feeling like 127 minutes of flop sweat.",
        "One of the best, most satisfying and certainly adult roller-coaster rides of this summer.",
        "After two previous Deadpool movies featuring funny Wolverine references, this threequel finally delivers the mash-up that fans (and Reynolds himself) have been waiting to see.",
        "An absolute blast, mixing savage humor, intense action, and heartfelt moments.",
        "Deadpool & Wolverine is the ultimate love letter to Marvel fans: The cameos and references are aplenty and brilliant, the source material is treated with respect and, best of all, it\u2019s pure, unadulterated fun.",
        "Deadpool & Wolverine uses every weapon in the Merc\u2019s arsenal to revive the clich\u00e9d multiverse genre.",
        "The third film about the loudmouth mercenary is not a triumphant entrance, but rather a wake with good jokes. [Full review in Spanish]",
        "Even as someone who finds Ryan Reynolds an acquired taste, Deadpool & Wolverine is reasonably diverting with some terrific high points.",
        "It\u2019s hoary, goofy, and tongue-in-cheek, but it\u2019s weirdly moving all the same.",
        "The cure for superhero fatigue is mocking the living hell out of it.",
        "Propelled by personality and pizzazz, the very funny, very bloody and very meta \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d is an epic throwdown teaming two very different superheroes played by a pair of dynamic superstars.",
        "Stylishly choreographed combat, winking fan service, and above all, a dogged dedication to burying itself up its own ass.",
        "It\u2019s not quite the silliest MCU plot ever, but nearly two decades into this whole thing, it\u2019s one of the least engaging. It\u2019s phoned in, like the writers have realised that plot is no longer what audiences are turning up for.",
        "For viewers who spend a lot of their time online, soaking up the discourse generated by insider-fan accounts and message boards, all of this will seem warmly familiar. But good luck if you\u2019re coming in with no prior knowledge.",
        "For the true believers, Deadpool & Wolverine is sure to please. It\u2019s a film made specifically with them in mind and it isn\u2019t scared to show them the love; every inch of it.",
        "Though mileage may vary for the uninitiated or even more casual CBM fans, Deadpool and Wolverine is a demented delight. Go in knowing what to expect and you're in for one of the most relentlessly entertaining movies in quite some time.",
        "A pure popcorn flick designed to entertain, and it succeeds with flying, bloody colours. It's a wild ride from start to finish, packed with action, laughs, and enough meta-references to satisfy even the most jaded comic book movie fan.",
        "Whatever its flaws as a story, it's still an entertaining experience; the rapid-fire gags often hit the target, the action is solid if rarely memorable, and the cameos are... well, they're there for the fans",
        "Calling this a movie is generous.",
        "Will undoubtedly delight Marvel fanboys of all ages. But to casual viewers it will come across as a rather unpleasant mess of snarky humor, ultra-violence and spurious sentiment.",
        "Deadpool & Wolverine weaves the Fox, Marvel, and Disney universes together into an epic, hard-R journey of heart, humor, and heroism. The dynamic duo of Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman take their winning chemistry to glory.",
        "A riotously entertaining superhero team-up that is the most fun the Marvel Cinematic Universe has had in years.",
        "It's not complex art, but it was never intended to be, and watching the film expecting it to be something it's not would be an exercise in futility. Fans will love it, others will enjoy it for its qualities, and some will hate it. Full review in Spanish.",
        "It\u2019s far from perfect, but when the pieces come together, Deadpool & Wolverine is a damn good time.",
        "A reliably funny retread, replete with dick jokes, over-the-top action sequences, loads of gratuitous violence and plenty of digital blood-letting...Gibberish though it unquestionably is, the film is a super-sized lark,",
        "Once the buzz of giggling wears off, it's clear: Deadpool & Wolverine isn't here to save superhero movies. It's here to show off Disney's newly acquired IP.",
        "Deadpool & Wolverine are here not only to offer a return to those good old days pre-snap, but help us remember what made us love the MCU in the first place, just from a very adult POV.",
        "Probably the most fun you'll have in a movie theater this summer",
        "A wildly fun vehicle delivered with plenty of passion for this franchise and a surprisingly endearing beautiful tribute to what came before. Grab your popcorn and enjoy.",
        "Deadpool and Wolverine is a must-see MCU experience; giddy, gruesome, and more emotional than you\u2019d expect... in other words, let\u2019s f**king go.",
        "Deadpool & Wolverine is a cinematic delight. It is a loving tribute to decades of Marvel multi-media projects while being just as loud, brash, and bloody as the first two Deadpool movies.",
        "[Deadpool & Wolverine has] got the irreverent humor... Lots of bloody, brutal action. A lot of inappropriate jokes. Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool [and] Hugh Jackman as Wolverine - they are the best at their game.",
        "Deadpool & Wolverine is one of the most entertaining Marvel films I've seen in years. Beyond hilarious, satisfying in terms of action & violence, it leaves you with this filling of fulfillment in payoffs to moments we've waited for years. A day one watch!",
        "A total blast! Wildly entertaining, irreverent and outrageously funny.",
        "Whether you\u2019re a fan of the old, the new, or just the long underpants crew in general, Deadpool & Wolverine will take you there.",
        "More than anything else, Deadpool & Wolverine is tiring.",
        "Openly admitting that these characters are coming into the MCU at a low point, Deadpool & Wolverine is a high point. It's a relentlessly outrageous blast handled with touching reverence",
        "This silly, sophomoric romp packs more meta gags than a dozen 'Scream' sequels",
        "Deadpool and Wolverine is a layered, hydraulic energized action comedy that has single-handedly reinvigorated the superhero genre back where it belongs. Corrin, Jackman and Reynolds are a great dynamic trio",
        "Deadpool and Wolverine is the most fun I\u2019ve had with a Marvel film since Thor: Ragnarok.",
        "Deadpool & Wolverine isn\u2019t the saviour of the MCU, but nor is it another in the recent run of fumbles.",
        "This is an R-rated love letter to comic book movies\u2014a much-needed, unfiltered adrenaline shot straight into Marvel's heart, potentially reviving it from the dead. It's pure, well-earned fan service and a must-see blockbuster!",
        "From beginning to end thus is one heck of a ride. The fight choreography in this film is some of Marvel's best work to date. The brutality is unparalleled, unlike anything they've delivered before. The humor is nonstop, leaving no time to recover.",
        "I have not laughed so hard in a movie theatre in what feels like years. The comedy on display is solid gold for comic book nerds.",
        "...the script is intended not just for those who know their X-Men from X-Force, but, for example, which actors are divorced in real life and from whom, and which superhero projects got stalled in development or had behind-the-scenes drama.",
        "Deadpool & Wolverine feels like the opposite of what came before it, with a narrative that would appear to be driven entirely by the 20th Century Fox characters Marvel might want to make movies about in the future.",
        "Reynolds and Jackman have tremendous chemistry. The movie expertly balances the exciting, the silly, the references for the fans and the straightforward superhero stuff, even a few glimpses of actual sincerity.",
        "Deadpool & Wolverine is ridiculously fun while it lasts. I laughed harder than I have in a long time at some of the jokes, which even caused a few groans of offended sensibilities in my press screening. I consider that an admirable sign.",
        "Deadpool & Wolverine sees a multiverse collide with a reunion fans have long been waiting for, while also delivering one of the best Marvel films.",
        "Its action is often implied; key instances of impact are usually cut around, or away from entirely. Its drama is heavily alluded to, but rarely felt or seen. For a movie whose every frame is stuffed to the gills, it's surprisingly empty.",
        "It is, in its own irreverent way, a celebration of everything that makes the MCU great.",
        "The movie is funny, even if it throws every joke at you. Sadly, Deadpool's entrance into the MCU gets the welcome gift of lackluster villains and wonky VFX.",
        "It is a film about how anything that was ever successful in Hollywood is made to repeat that same song and dance endlessly... Deadpool & Wolverine devilishly plays on this, of course. It is watchable because it\u2019s self-reflective.",
        "As a visually driven filmmaker, Levy\u2019s style is dull and uninspired \u2014 he over-directs the action, to the point where nothing feels effortlessly conceived, and everything turns out slick and flat",
        "Struggles with tonal balance and repetition. However, it\u2019s hard to deny the spirit of the endeavor, which is meant to be wild and surprising.",
        "Once again, the biggest predicaments with Deadpool\u2019s universe are those of invincibility and unlimited power - elements the humor can't fully mask.",
        "This is the only Marvel movie this year, after a string of failures. Enjoy it like a dessert.",
        "Deadpool is and always has been a faux-naughty edgelord and tryhard. While it will likely amuse its target audience of geeks and the terminally online, \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d is a whole lot of hot air and not much else.",
        "Led by Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman at the top of their superhero game, Deadpool & Wolverine is an absurd blast of a Marvel multiverse joyride.",
        "the raunchy self-referential humor worked most of the time and I was laughing",
        "Comic-literate nerds are going to salivate for the cameos and entertaining fight sequences, but overall this is an annoyingly coy, unfunny, and sorely disappointing movie.",
        "It's hilarious from start to finish with tons of X-Men and MCU references, and countless cameos for your nerdy pleasure. Disney ownership didn't affect the irreverence of the franchise with the filmmakers doubling down on the provocative and violence.",
        "So yes, this has plenty of surprises, great action, humor that pokes fun of the MCU, it\u2019s entertaining, no doubt about it, but. The story is a mess and the character and emotions beats are paper thin.",
        "Reynolds demonstrates a true understanding of the demented mind of Deadpool. Over the course of three films he has perfected the blend of vulgar comedy, gratuitous violence and a surprising amount of impactful sentiment.",
        "...Deadpool & Wolverine at least aims for self-deprecating laughs and easy-going entertainment, but the humour is tiresomely blunt and sour despite a game cast\u2026",
        "Deadpool & Wolverine takes a joke-filled grenade and throws it at previous perceptions of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This hyperactive superhero sequel goes all-in with meta references, surprise appearances, and male homoerotic flirting.",
        "Deadpool and Wolverine was a bloody, action-packed, cameo-fest all wrapped up in a heartwarming love letter to Marvel fans. All of the fun comic references, easter eggs, and cameos make this sequel the most Marvely MCU film since Spider-Man No Way Home.",
        "Ebulliently directed by Shawn Levy, this is a hyperactive cheese dream that brings together two of Marvel\u2019s best characters and a supporting cast who will have nerds frothing at the mouth.",
        "To paraphrase TS Eliot, these fragments has Marvel shored against its ruins, though the crumbling continues regardless.",
        "There is a difference between tossing out references and making a movie that is genuinely funny, thrilling, energetic and innovative. At nearly every turn, Deadpool & Wolverine aspires to work in direct opposition to such goals.",
        "Deadpool & Wolverine goes a long way to restoring some of the lost luster from The Multiverse Saga. For Deadpool and Wolverine fans, this is a must-see.",
        "I\u2019d rather just watch a movie than be pandered to by one.",
        "Deadpool & Wolverine does a disarmingly effective job of convincing its audience that this is a film about nostalgia for beloved characters when it\u2019s really just bridging a gap between one company\u2019s output and another\u2019s.",
        "Like a serial murderer wistfully eulogizing his victims, it's both a \"victory lap\" for corporate consolidation and \"for the fans\" nostalgia trip that puts it closer in spirit to 'Rise of Skywalker' than 'Spider-Man: No Way Home'.",
        "Deadpool might not be Marvel Jesus, but Deadpool & Wolverine is the shot of adrenaline that this cinematic universe has needed for some time, and an exciting reminder of how amusing and exciting this world can be when it just has fun.",
        "Ridiculous even by superhero standards, it remains more or less coherent.",
        "Superfans of the entire Marvel universe will find this film filled with top-notch comedy and action, Easter eggs, cameos that left the audience gasping and cheering, a lot of meta jokes and digs at 20th Century Fox.",
        "Reynolds and Jackman, real-life friends who often jest at each other, make a delightful pairing in this film.",
        "The movie is chaotic, as expected in a Deadpool film. However, within the chaos, they found time to give characters emotional arcs and moments and let those scenes breathe. Great action, great performances, a ton of fun.",
        "Real-world MCU supremo Kevin Feige has turned all the \u201cno\u201d switches to \u201cyes\u201d and unleashed the most violent, funny, self-critiquing, cameo-laden MCU film imaginable.",
        "Unfortunately, this plot, and the gags around it, only undercut Deadpool and the very narrow lane of pathos that makes him tick.",
        "It\u2019s all great fun, and it\u2019s just enough to overcome the uninspired direction, mid-level special effects and hit-and-miss humor.",
        "As with its predecessors, those who can\u2019t stand Deadpool or aren\u2019t educated in Marvel movie lore won\u2019t tolerate a second of it. The rest will be in bleeping heaven.",
        "\u201cDeadpool and Wolverine\u201d could have easily been mere fan service, but the powers-that-be have taken the time to draft and raucous, violent cinematic adventure.",
        "This movie does a great job of being both a \"Deadpool\" threequel and the first \"Deadpool\" film in the MCU. But still, something feels like it's missing.",
        "'Marvel Rumors Subreddit: The Motion Picture;' - a cameo-and-reference party that's plenty of fun doing what it does, but we probably don't need to do it again.",
        "It\u2019s definitely not for everybody, but even a non-fan stumbling into the theater accidentally will find whole sections here to enjoy.",
        "There's some fun stuff here and there, but for most of the way, this one is overstuffed, exhausting, and with an overarching air of \"nothing matters.\"",
        "Deadpool & Wolverine not only delivers the team-up of the century but the best Marvel film in five years.",
        "An apology candygram delivered by the two most mouth-puckeringly sour superheroes Marvel now owns.",
        "It's a roast of all of this nonsense, while still getting to the heart of these characters.",
        "For all of its big-ticket fan service and willingness to poke fun at how much of a drag the MCU\u2019s become, Deadpool & Wolverine feels like a sign that the days of genuinely exciting Marvel movies might just be behind us.",
        "Think of it as a superhero bickering buddy movie, super sized for the MCU.  This is witty and wild mature meta-madness. I don't want to give spoilers, but my review prepares you with some historical hints.",
        "For the core audience, the gags will be reward enough, even if the rest of us might squirm as the sloppily staged action grows repetitive, the plotting haphazard and the humor so self-aware the movie threatens to disappear up its own ass.",
        "Deadpool & Wolverine is a serviceable cut of pure, unadulterated fan service. In fact, you'll risk an overdose while watching.",
        "As good as he is, Jackman\u2019s return, and wearing that impressive Yellow with Blue suit, is perfection and I would say his strongest turn ever as Wolverine, at least one that gives what he did in Logan a run for its money.",
        "An instant comic book classic, and not just a return to form for Marvel but a refocusing. Ryan Reynolds arrives at Marvel like a seismic event, while Hugh Jackman has never been better as a comics accurate Wolverine. Pure fun, especially for fans.",
        "Come for the jokes, the cameos, and the gleefully anarchic energy, but stay for Hugh Jackman giving his A-plus-plus game to a project that he could\u2019ve easily phoned in. Also the dog. You will love the dog.",
        "From cameos to background Easter eggs to long-fan-ficked meet-ups, it\u2019s a relentless onslaught of surprises designed to get audiences screaming and throwing popcorn in the air.",
        "[Deadpool & Wolverine is] a biting love letter to all the films that brought us to the point we are today.",
        "Deadpool & Wolverine is not only one of Marvel\u2019s best films but one of the best comic book films in general.",
        "Deadpool & Wolverine is about as lazy as a blockbuster can get.",
        "Deadpool & Wolverine is as much fun as you can conceivably have at a corporate merger meeting.",
        "The results are a mixed bag of occasionally funny one-liners and characters you forgot you probably complained about online in the 2000s.",
        "It\u2019s a poignant summation of the Fox chapter of the Marvel saga.",
        "Yes please: we\u2019ll take as many Wolverine crossovers as Marvel is willing to dish out, as long as they taste as good as this one.",
        "Despite wonky CGI and messy story holes, Deadpool & Wolverine delivers wit, laughs, dismemberment, and a captivating experience all in an irreverent package that pays respect to both franchises, while also eviscerating their corporate entities.",
        "The MCU\u2019s self-appointed messiah might not have pulled off a complete course correction, but he delivers an action-packed, gag-stuffed crowdpleaser that gives the franchise a much needed lift. Jackman is worth his weight in adamantium.",
        "Undeniably crowd pleasing for the right audience, Deadpool & Wolverine caters to its fanbase and, in that regard, emerges truly victorious.",
        "It is a carnival of in-jokes, self-references, and reality breaks with no higher purpose than to congratulate its audience for keeping up. It has no stakes, no drama, and only the most cynical applications of creativity.",
        "Deadpool & Wolverine will reinvigorate this franchise, as it injects the glorious madness of our merc with a mouth in the best (and most self-aware) way... Those who show up for the dynamic between our title characters will get an insane amount of payoff.",
        "A shameless piece of self-congratulation, fueled by self-cannibalism, as the studio which built its identity on superhero crossovers finally abandons the pretense of trying to justify them dramatically.",
        "\" ... it really is full of heart (and possibly a few actual hearts) ... [the film] does something I thought was impossible. It gives the MCU a soft reset, and a chance to untangle themselves from the spaghettified mess that is the multiverse saga.\"",
        "A fun, generally well-made summer movie. The sole MCU release of 2024, \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d proves it\u2019s not necessarily the source material that\u2019s causing so-called superhero fatigue.",
        "It\u2019s amusing and exhausting.",
        "As the song says, Hugh Jackman is having the time of his life. Because of that, so is Ryan Reynolds. Because of that, so are we.",
        "Deadpool & Wolverine may not be as cohesive as many other, better, Marvel movies, but only one or two can match it in terms of pure joy and reverence for the genre. Fans will absolutely adore it and even non-fans should, at the very least, marvel at it.",
        "Despite being right in the demographic crosshairs for its incessant geek culture references, I found myself as exhausted with this film as I have been with any other installment in the lackluster Multiverse Saga.",
        "This one is for those that have been Marvel fans since the very beginning. Incredible action, unforgettable surprises, epic needledrops. Not just bonkers R-rated jokes, it's packed with heart too. Bring the tissues (you can also use them for your tears!).",
        "Deadpool & Wolverine is such a pleasant surprise \u2014 both in its jaw-dropping elements and in the sentimental reason for those elements even existing \u2014 that it almost feels like a miracle.",
        "While retaking its cinematic crown will be a challenge, \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d is a giant, promising step forward for the franchise.",
        "Must we continually be served flavorless gruel and pretend it's nourishing?",
        "Miraculously, the heartfelt stuff isn\u2019t buried by the film\u2019s commitment to nonstop shenanigans and giddy self-awareness.",
        "Deadpool & Wolverine doesn\u2019t flinch from speaking some measure of truth to power.",
        "Deadpool & Wolverine is viciously violent, unbelievably stupid, irreverently funny, deliciously deranged, and incredibly heartfelt. Two hours and seven minutes of ass-kicking, ass-slapping, and ass-kissing perfection.",
        "Beneath the outlandishness, half-dozen belly laughs and nerd-centric beats resides sweet nostalgia for the last quarter-century of superhero movies, while demonstrating that Marvel Studios possesses the power to laugh at itself.",
        "Honestly, it appears to exist solely to make money.",
        "An outrageous, consistently funny superhero comedy that succeeds largely thanks to the contagious enthusiasm of leads Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman, and a surprisingly classy perspective on superhero movie history.",
        "I don\u2019t think it is the messiah people want it to be, and that\u2019s a good thing. It is a movie about Deadpool and Wolverine, just as it should be.",
        "Deadpool & Wolverine is the kind of injection of bravado that Marvel needs right now. It\u2019s easily the funniest film of the year, and I\u2019m not sure you\u2019ll find a more entertaining one.",
        "When all is said and done, Deadpool & Wolverine ticks all the boxes a fan could want in a Marvel movie. It's the best installment in the franchise, the best Marvel movie since Avengers: Endgame, and it charts a bold new path for the MCU.",
        "Deadpool & Wolverine is an absolute blast: an action-packed, hilarious, heartfelt and inventive love letter to Marvel fans 25+ years in the making.",
        "Deadpool & Wolverine will be everything and more to its target audience, but for those that aren't terminally online, there is a good chance half of the movie's jokes and set pieces will be meaningless to them.",
        "The first Marvel Cinematic Universe flick to get an R certificate in the US, is, despite that supposed confirmation of mature content, the most relentlessly juvenile entry in a sequence that has rarely been confused with Ingmar Bergman\u2019s Faith trilogy.",
        "Neither the quips nor the knowingly over-the-top fight scenes are as lethal as in the earlier pictures, and the film\u2019s wisecracking tone is undercut by the baggage of having to adhere to the MCU\u2019s ungainly overarching narrative.",
        "Make no mistake, though, Deadpool and Wolverine is a comedy first; a vulgar, R-rated, often juvenile comedy that provides an abundance of laughs, if for no other reason than it throws out more jokes than any other movie this year.",
        "With the exception of a few rough edges, Deadpool & Wolverine rises to the occasion as a summer blockbuster spark that could reignite the fervor around the Marvel Cinematic Universe. If future projects keep this up, that could be a great thing.",
        "Once Deadpool & Wolverine enters the trash-heap zone, however, it embraces the already meta-aspects of the series to an absurd degree and never looks back.",
        "Deadpool & Wolverine is a nerd-gasm of the highest regard making it one of the best in the Marvel, Deadpool, X-Men franchises.",
        "It doesn\u2019t just feel like it\u2019s going through the motions; it feels sad. Like a high school reunion where everyone showed up wearing what they did twenty years ago.",
        "Deadpool & Wolverine rescues something kind of beautiful from the ugliness that superhero movies have perpetuated for so long. Not visually, of course, but in several other key respects.",
        "Deadpool & Wolverine knows exactly what it is... It doesn\u2019t try to please any naysayers. Instead, Deadpool & Wolverine has too much fun mocking, and celebrating, superhero movie history to worry about winning any one over.",
        "If nothing else, Deadpool & Wolverine gives fans reason to be hyped for the Marvel Cinematic Universe's future again. The team-up \u2013 not just Ryan and Hugh, but Deadpool and Disney \u2013 was worth the anticipation.",
        "The movie jokes about fan service while delivering it.",
        "Deadpool & Wolverine delivers laughs, nostalgia, and top-notch fan service despite a long setup and a forgettable villain. Reynolds and Jackman's chemistry shines in this R-rated, action-packed Marvel adventure.",
        "I have to say Deadpool & Wolverine was a hilarious and bloody superhero comic that came to life and an excellent time in the movie theater.",
        "Deadpool & Wolverine is serviceable in its worst moments and a lot of fun when it\u2019s really cooking. Yet if your expectations for Deadpool & Wolverine include a clean explanation of where the Marvel multiverse stands, perhaps lower them.",
        "Serves as both Deadpool\u2019s grand introduction into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and a touching, sincere, and hilarious send-off to the 20th Century Fox era of superheroes.",
        "A masterclass in meta-humor, charisma and cameo-chaos, this is a riotous, self-aware spectacle that gleefully mocks superhero conventions while still delivering the adrenaline-pumping action MCU fans having been craving since Avengers: Endgame.",
        "\u2018Deadpool & Wolverine\u2019 humorously diverts in the moment, but as a durable movie or even a long-lasting MCU film, it\u2019s no slam dunk.",
        "Deadpool & Wolverine is the spark this franchise desperately needed. It\u2019s vulgar, bloody, and violent, and it closes the door on one era of Marvel while opening the door to something that\u2019s been lacking in the MCU for quite some time: optimism.",
        "It's pure fan service, so knock off a star if you were after more, but Deadpool & Wolverine knows it's fan service \u2013 and it doesn't f**king care.",
        "The foulest, filthiest, fourth wall breaking sequel ever - but at what point are we literally beating the Dead(pool) horse?",
        "Deadpool & Wolverine is about everything I wanted + a little more. Entertaining, bloodthirsty, hilarious, & even a shot in the arm to the MCU! A refreshing look at the multiverse saga & and entertaining riot. I can't wait to watch again",
        "A gleefully violent and nostalgia-heavy superhero action-comedy.",
        "Deadpool & Wolverine is a funny, gory, and meta introduction of/tribute to Fox superheroes by Marvel. It's an absolute blast.",
        "...there are some extraordinarily satisfying and surprising moments in DEADPOOL & WOLVERINE, and they deserve to be experienced fresh...",
        "\"Deadpool & Wolverine\" is a chaotically violent, vulgar, and entertaining time at the movies. It has lots of jokes and amusing set pieces, but it also has a ton of heart behind it, which you can feel coming through all of the actors' performances.",
        "There are lulls and the film could have used a director with more of a flair for action, but Deadpool & Wolverine is filled with wonderfully crowd-pleasing moments for fans of superhero movies and some truly hysterical jokes.",
        "Deadpool & Wolverine keeps the anti-hero\u2019s foul-mouth and blood-soaked tendencies alive for his MCU debut. It\u2019s a shame the story isn\u2019t able to shift the franchise\u2019s slump into a better direction.",
        "As Marvel Studios slows down and reevaluates their superhero landscape, Deadpool & Wolverine shows that there is still plenty of gas left in the tank. Gas that is then poured all over the past and present Marvel filmography and gloriously set ablaze.",
        "A contender for the best superhero movie ever, Deadpool & Wolverine is two hours of Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman proving they were born to play these roles and, crucially, be part of the MCU. It\u2019s a f***ing masterpiece.",
        "The ultimate Marvel movie, a non-stop blockbuster entertainer with a heart of gold. Ryan Reynolds is Marvel Jesus, breathing new life into the MCU and resurrecting the X-Man himself Hugh Jackman for one of the most wildly enjoyable comic book movies ever.",
        "'Deadpool & Wolverine' is the funniest movie of the year and fan service at its most entertaining.",
        "Deadpool & Wolverine settles for manic, gamer-style ultraviolence where death isn\u2019t a thing, really, but where the grotesque sight gags start to feel not simply hollow, but kind of awful.",
        "Deadpool & Wolverine operates with a reckless abandon that, through all the bottomless irreverent humor and pizazz on screen, smears its blood and guts from a surprising and corrective place of love.",
        "\"Deadpool and Wolverine' seems to exist only as Kevin Feige\u2019s desperate attempt to clutch some much needed \u201cwe\u2019re so back\u201d from the jaws of \u201cit\u2019s so over\u201d defeat.",
        "This, folks, is maximalist Deadpool, with all the resources of an Avengers team-up tentpole but the same old shameless shtick.",
        "It may not be one of the best films of the year, but it is one of the most entertaining. Reynolds brings the laughs, Jackman brings the heart, and the 4th wall breaking nature of the franchise allows it to get away with some multi-verse insanity.",
        "I have changed the link to my spoiler review of Deadpool, which also has a link to the non-spoiler review. Both are positive. I added the spoiler review because so many critics seem to be having a hard time understanding the movie. Not that hard."
