            "Cumbersome plotting aside, there\u2019s enough gory mayhem and genuine zingers to make Deadpool & Wolverine a fun ride in a packed and up-for-it cinema.",
            "It\u2019s amusing at times, especially for fans of the MCU as several Marvel superhero movie stars pop up in cameo roles...",
            "Some of the jokes land through sheer volume and force of will, but it feels like you have to endure 40-or-so rectal stabbings for a single juicy zinger. ",
            "The tonal battle between the two characters is a walkover. Between the frenzied slapstick violence and battery of gags, two hours plus pass in a finger click. ",
            "Avengers/X-Men fans who're looking for fun, keep your ears open. The real party is in the freaky chatter.",
            "Hall H&#58; The Movie&#44; offering up an onslaught of familiar &#40;though largely forgotten&#41; superhero faces intended to elicit knowing&#44; nostalgic nods and applause&#46;",
            "There are times when Deadpool &amp; Wolverine seems to understand the futility of its own fixations&#46; Yet the movie ultimately endorses Deadpool&apos;s left-field desire for conformity with tired&#44; oft-stated MCU ideals&#46; ",
            "I\u2019m not entirely immune to the charms of this approach; there\u2019s one casting choice, in particular, that made me smile, almost in spite of myself. It\u2019s not enough to make the movie feel like less of a self-cannibalizing slog.",
            "Dotted in among the quips and Easter eggs is the superhero equivalent of Toy Story 2, a mournful goodbye to the things we once held dear, even if some of those things weren\u2019t that great to begin with.",
            "A messy multiverse film overrun with guest appearances and Easter eggs.",
            "A film can be obnoxious and simultaneously very funny, and Deadpool & Wolverine is frequently hilarious. But it\u2019s also slapdash, repetitive and shoddy looking, with an overreliance on meme-derived gags and achingly meta comic fan in-jokes.",
            "Rowdy, raunchy and gooey gory, Deadpool & Wolverine delivers the action-comedy thrills that will attract Marvel acolytes and civilians seeking belly laughs.",
            "Even draped in copious amounts of irony&#44; the nonstop fan service grows wearisome&#46;",
            "Though the MCU has never served up the cinematic equivalent of fine dining&#44; its films at least used to be hearty fast-food fare&#46; Deadpool &amp; Wolverine feels more like eating a bag of Sour Patch Kids and calling it dinner&#46; ",
            "A celebration of trash&#58; as in it revels in Deadpool&apos;s brand of trashy humour&#44; but also celebrates the discarded superheroes who we can&apos;t help but get sentimental about&#44; following the same easy route to our feelings that Spider-Man&#58; No Way Home took&#46;",
            "Is it a great movie&#63; Nah&#46; It&apos;s too slick a Marvel package&#44; with surprisingly meh special effects and an energy that&#8217;s more desperation than inspiration&#46; But stars Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman are willing to bust a gut to make you laugh&#46; So there&#8217;s that&#46;",
            "While Ryan Reynolds still seems to be having fun playing the cheeky mercenary&#44; both the inside-baseball comedy and the cartoonishly bloody mayhem wear out their welcomes in the film&#8217;s final third&#46;",
            "Reynolds exhausted that creative well with the first two Deadpool entries and is only dredging up sloshy wet sand this time out&#46;",
            "It&#8217;s over-the-top&#44; overstuffed and light on emotional depth&#46; But it&#8217;s also a hell of a fun time&#44; especially if you appreciate Deadpool&#8217;s self-aware&#44; meta humour&#46; It&#8217;s often infantile but that doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s not funny&#46; You just have to go with it&#46;",
            "Although it continues to rely on tired tropes and fan service-y storytelling beats, Deadpool & Wolverine remains a fun theatrical experience for the summer and one of the better releases from Marvel in recent years.",
            "Bugs Bunny, who in his prime never stuck around for more than seven minutes, would have slunk away in boredom long ago.",
            "Messy as it is, Deadpool & Wolverine is the first MCU movie in several years that\u2019s mostly enjoyable. It\u2019s also, at times, overdone. ",
            "Overall it is middling, but sure to make enough money to keep ketchup and mustard coming back well into their 90s.",
            "Alternately hilarious and exhausting and stuffed with more meta-narrative than it has actual narrative, Deadpool & Wolverine is a massive corporate in-joke masquerading as a movie.",
            "Somehow, despite the silly mayhem and hyper-meta goofing, I kinda did care about the characters, especially in the finale, which unspools a pathos firehose and blasts us with it.",
            "One of the best, most satisfying and certainly adult roller-coaster rides of this summer. ",
            "Deadpool & Wolverine is the ultimate love letter to Marvel fans: The cameos and references are aplenty and brilliant, the source material is treated with respect and, best of all, it\u2019s pure, unadulterated fun. ",
            "The cure for superhero fatigue is mocking the living hell out of it.",
            "For viewers who spend a lot of their time online, soaking up the discourse generated by insider-fan accounts and message boards, all of this will seem warmly familiar. But good luck if you\u2019re coming in with no prior knowledge.",
            "Once the buzz of giggling wears off&#44; it&apos;s clear&#58; Deadpool &amp; Wolverine isn&apos;t here to save superhero movies&#46; It&apos;s here to show off Disney&apos;s newly acquired IP&#46; ",
            "Reynolds and Jackman have tremendous chemistry&#46; The movie expertly balances the exciting&#44; the silly&#44; the references for the fans and the straightforward superhero stuff&#44; even a few glimpses of actual sincerity&#46; ",
            "It is a film about how anything that was ever successful in Hollywood is made to repeat that same song and dance endlessly... Deadpool & Wolverine devilishly plays on this, of course. It is watchable because it\u2019s self-reflective. ",
            "Deadpool is and always has been a faux-naughty edgelord and tryhard&#46; While it will likely amuse its target audience of geeks and the terminally online&#44; &#8220;Deadpool &amp; Wolverine&#8221; is a whole lot of hot air and not much else&#46;",
            "Ebulliently directed by Shawn Levy, this is a hyperactive cheese dream that brings together two of Marvel\u2019s best characters and a supporting cast who will have nerds frothing at the mouth.",
            "To paraphrase TS Eliot, these fragments has Marvel shored against its ruins, though the crumbling continues regardless.\n",
            "There is a difference between tossing out references and making a movie that is genuinely funny, thrilling, energetic and innovative. At nearly every turn, Deadpool & Wolverine aspires to work in direct opposition to such goals.",
            "I\u2019d rather just watch a movie than be pandered to by one.",
            "Deadpool & Wolverine does a disarmingly effective job of convincing its audience that this is a film about nostalgia for beloved characters when it\u2019s really just bridging a gap between one company\u2019s output and another\u2019s.",
            "Ridiculous even by superhero standards, it remains more or less coherent.",
            "Superfans of the entire Marvel universe will find this film filled with top-notch comedy and action, Easter eggs, cameos that left the audience gasping and cheering, a lot of meta jokes and digs at 20th Century Fox.\n",
            "Real-world MCU supremo Kevin Feige has turned all the \u201cno\u201d switches to \u201cyes\u201d and unleashed the most violent, funny, self-critiquing, cameo-laden MCU film imaginable.",
            "It\u2019s all great fun, and it\u2019s just enough to overcome the uninspired direction, mid-level special effects and hit-and-miss humor. ",
            "As with its predecessors&#44; those who can&#8217;t stand Deadpool or aren&#8217;t educated in Marvel movie lore won&#8217;t tolerate a second of it&#46; The rest will be in bleeping heaven&#46;",
            "It\u2019s definitely not for everybody, but even a non-fan stumbling into the theater accidentally will find whole sections here to enjoy.",
            "An apology candygram delivered by the two most mouth-puckeringly sour superheroes Marvel now owns&#46;",
            "For the core audience, the gags will be reward enough, even if the rest of us might squirm as the sloppily staged action grows repetitive, the plotting haphazard and the humor so self-aware the movie threatens to disappear up its own ass.",
            "From cameos to background Easter eggs to long-fan-ficked meet-ups, it\u2019s a relentless onslaught of surprises designed to get audiences screaming and throwing popcorn in the air.",
            "Deadpool & Wolverine is as much fun as you can conceivably have at a corporate merger meeting. ",
            "The results are a mixed bag of occasionally funny one-liners and characters you forgot you probably complained about online in the 2000s&#46;",
            "It\u2019s a poignant summation of the Fox chapter of the Marvel saga.",
            "Yes please: we\u2019ll take as many Wolverine crossovers as Marvel is willing to dish out, as long as they taste as good as this one.",
            "It is a carnival of in-jokes&#44; self-references&#44; and reality breaks with no higher purpose than to congratulate its audience for keeping up&#46; It has no stakes&#44; no drama&#44; and only the most cynical applications of creativity&#46; ",
            "A shameless piece of self-congratulation&#44; fueled by self-cannibalism&#44; as the studio which built its identity on superhero crossovers finally abandons the pretense of trying to justify them dramatically&#46;",
            "A fun, generally well-made summer movie. The sole MCU release of 2024, \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d proves it\u2019s not necessarily the source material that\u2019s causing so-called superhero fatigue.",
            "It\u2019s amusing and exhausting.",
            "Despite being right in the demographic crosshairs for its incessant geek culture references, I found myself as exhausted with this film as I have been with any other installment in the lackluster Multiverse Saga. ",
            "While retaking its cinematic crown will be a challenge, \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d is a giant, promising step forward for the franchise.",
            "Miraculously, the heartfelt stuff isn\u2019t buried by the film\u2019s commitment to nonstop shenanigans and giddy self-awareness. ",
            "Deadpool &amp; Wolverine doesn&#8217;t flinch from speaking some measure of truth to power&#46;",
            "Beneath the outlandishness, half-dozen belly laughs and nerd-centric beats resides sweet nostalgia for the last quarter-century of superhero movies, while demonstrating that Marvel Studios possesses the power to laugh at itself.",
            "Honestly, it appears to exist solely to make money.",
            "The first Marvel Cinematic Universe flick to get an R certificate in the US&#44; is&#44; despite that supposed confirmation of mature content&#44; the most relentlessly juvenile entry in a sequence that has rarely been confused with Ingmar Bergman&#8217;s Faith trilogy&#46;",
            "Neither the quips nor the knowingly over-the-top fight scenes are as lethal as in the earlier pictures, and the film\u2019s wisecracking tone is undercut by the baggage of having to adhere to the MCU\u2019s ungainly overarching narrative. ",
            "Once Deadpool & Wolverine enters the trash-heap zone, however, it embraces the already meta-aspects of the series to an absurd degree and never looks back.",
            "Deadpool & Wolverine rescues something kind of beautiful from the ugliness that superhero movies have perpetuated for so long. Not visually, of course, but in several other key respects.",
            "Deadpool &amp; Wolverine is serviceable in its worst moments and a lot of fun when it&#8217;s really cooking&#46; Yet if your expectations for Deadpool &amp; Wolverine include a clean explanation of where the Marvel multiverse stands&#44; perhaps lower them&#46;",
            "A masterclass in meta-humor&#44; charisma and cameo-chaos&#44; this is a riotous&#44; self-aware spectacle that gleefully mocks superhero conventions while still delivering the adrenaline-pumping action MCU fans having been craving since Avengers&#58; Endgame&#46; ",
            "Deadpool & Wolverine settles for manic, gamer-style ultraviolence where death isn\u2019t a thing, really, but where the grotesque sight gags start to feel not simply hollow, but kind of awful."
